Four CSV files are available for download. 

(1) "sample_output_behavioral" contains sample data for the behavioral part of the task. 
(2) "sample_output_pupillometry" contains sample data for the pupillometry part of the task. 

Files ending in “_raw” represent the unmodified output generated by PsychoPy immediately after data collection.
Files ending in “_processed” show the same data after running the optional preprocessing scripts in the Python-Notebook-Preprocessing folder. These scripts add the “State” column, which classifies each trial as exploration or exploitation based on participants’ accuracy patterns within each block.

These files can be used as reference to verify that the task is functioning correctly on your system.
