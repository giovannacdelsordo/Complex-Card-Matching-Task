This folder contains all the files required to run the pupillometry version of the Complex Card Sorting Task (CCMT).

Instructions:

Ensure that all files are stored in the same folder and saved locally on your device.

To start the task, open the CCM_task.py file using the PsychoPy Runner. There is no need to open any other files manually.

Upon completing the task, the output data files (.csv and .edf) will be saved in the same folder as the .py files.

Note that an EyeLink Eye-Tracker is necessary to run this task. The code will need to be adjusted for other types of eye-tracker. 

Note about the number of blocks and trials.
In the current version of the task, the default structure includes:
- Practice: 2 blocks of 10 trials for each difficulty level (easy and hard)
- Main experiment: 10 blocks of 10 trials for each difficulty levelBased on our calculations, a 45-minute testing session can comfortably accommodate approximately 15 blocks per difficulty level, assuming an average response time of 5 seconds per trial. These settings are therefore implemented as the default parameters in this version of the CCMT.

All block and trial counts are fully customizable in the script:
- Easy condition — practice: adjustable at lines 313 and 314
- Easy condition — main task: adjustable at lines 340 and 341
- Hard condition — practice: adjustable at lines 415 and 416
- Hard condition — main task: adjustable at lines 443 and 444

If you'd like to change the timing of the trials, go to the "librule.py".
To change how long participants have to answer, go to line 54. 
To increase or decrease the delay between the moment participants click on a card and feedback, go to line 55. 
To change how long the feedback window is displayed for, go to the main task code, and change the integer on line 131. 

To change the color of stimuli, change the color labels in the "libcard.py" file, line 13. 
To change the size of the cards and stimuli, go to the "librule.py", line 27.
