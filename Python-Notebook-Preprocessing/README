This folder contains two Python notebook to pre-process the behavioral and the pupillometry data. This pre-processing only concerns classification of each individual trials as either
Exploratory or Exploitative. 

The notebook for the behavioral data contains two pieces of code: 

(1) Classify trials and save all participants' data files into 1 single Excel file. 
(2) Classify trials and update each participant's data files and save them as individual data set. 

The notebook for the pupillometry data contains also two pieces of code: 

(1) Classify trials and update each participant's data files and save them as individual data set. 
(2) Transfer the newly created "State" column to the pupillometry data sets for each participant separately. 

Note that (1) you will first need to create sample reports for each individual EDF files and have them converted into Excel files; (2) no pre-processing of the actually pupil size 
measures are provided.
