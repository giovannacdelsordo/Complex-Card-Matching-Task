This folder contains two Jupyter notebooks used to preprocess the behavioral and pupillometry data. The preprocessing focuses exclusively on classifying each individual trial as either Exploration or Exploitation.

Behavioral Data Notebook
  This notebook includes two workflows:
  - Classify trials and save all participants’ data into a single Excel file.
  - Classify trials for each participant individually and save updated files with the new State column added.

Pupillometry Data Notebook
  This notebook also provides two workflows:
  - Classify trials and update each participant’s behavioral data file, saving the results as individual datasets.
  - Transfer the newly generated “State” column to each participant’s corresponding pupillometry dataset.

Additional Notes
- Before running the pupillometry preprocessing steps, you must generate sample reports for each EDF file and convert them to Excel (.xlsx) format.
- These notebooks do not include any preprocessing of the pupil-size time series themselves; they focus solely on trial-level state classification.
- Equivalent .py scripts are also provided for researchers who prefer to perform preprocessing outside Jupyter Notebooks.
